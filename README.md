#H1 Simplescript compiler

This is a project developed for the compiler's class at Instituto Militar de Engenharia. The goal of the project is to develop the front end of a compiler for the Simplescript language. For this project, the front end of a compiler comprises all the steps until the generation of an intermediate representation of the code. This representation is used so developes only have to worry about the backend of the compiler for different hardware architectures.
